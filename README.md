# randomvariables
This information is displayed in many books related to random variables and communication systems. However, most of them avoid practical step by step about the foundations to generate basic models. If this basic models are well defined, the next steps will have strong grounds on your research outputs.

## Rayleigh Distribution
The first random variable is related to the Rayleigh Channel (extremely used in wireless communication), it is modeled by Rayleigh Distribution.

Simulated and analytical version of Rayleigh Distribution. The random variable "R" defined by Rayleigh Distribution is generated by the following equation R = SQRT(X^2+Y^2), where X and Y are independent Gaussian Random variables with zero mean and Variance sigma^2. So, in communications, X is the real part of a complex number and Y is the imaginary part of the same complex number. This complex number is the base band representation of a Rayleigh channel. In communications the random variable R represents the module of this band base signal (complex number).
